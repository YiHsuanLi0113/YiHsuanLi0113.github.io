## 2018.05.12 - First Time to Use Github Page

Today is my first time to use Github Page. 
I spent all afternoon studying using it. 
Now my page's done.
I'm so excited and look forward to use it to record my learning about programming.

Howerer, I have to learn how to use "Markdown" to write down the article.@_@

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```csharp
Syntax highlighted code block
Console.WriteLine("Hello World");

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/YiHsuanLi0113/yihsuanli0113.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
